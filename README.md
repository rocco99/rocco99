  Make sure to copy the UserSetup.h file into the library as
  per the Github Instructions. The pins are defined in there.

  All libraries are required and shuld be installed if necessary.
  
  Note: If you find the colors mis-behaving, then you have
        probably copied the wrong User_Setup.h file. This was
        pointed out to me by Brian Lough. viz:
        I'd recommend checking to make sure you're using the right
        User_Setup.h. If your CYD version has 2 usb ports,
        you'll want to use the CYD2USB version.
        I noticed something similar when I was using the wrong version.
    
  This is a mish-mash of various things I found on the web, bits from
  the examples file and my own code.
